# searchInGraph
This is the implementation for 4 searching algorithm : Breadth First Search (BFS), Depth First Search (DFS), Uniform Cost Search (UCS), A-Star Algorithm
Coloring convention:
  • Blue: visited vertex
  • Red: has just discovered vertex
  • Black: unvisited vertex
  • Yellow: current vertex
  • Purple: goal vertex
  • Orange: start vertex
  • Green: edges of found path
  • Grey: unvisited vertices or edges
  • White: visited edges
  
 
  - How to run code?
  • python main.py input.txt <name of the algorithm> (bfs, dfs, ucs, a_star)
